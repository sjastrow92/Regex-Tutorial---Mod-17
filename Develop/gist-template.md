## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors contain symbols like a caret and a dollar sign at the end of the string or \A letter to create bounderies. The \letter suggests the end of the string. Anchors are a way of telling you where you are at in your code. \A refers to the start. The parameters of regex can vary from language to language. Some characters are the same across multiple languages and have the same meaning, but that is not true for all of them.
### Quantifiers
Regex quantifiers include characters like ?,*, +, and items within curly brackets. They are used to determine the number of occurances or number of items, mostly when it comes to incoming data. Hovering over certain parts of a line of code will tell you the purpose of certain quantifiers. For quantifiers, if you look at W3 schools, almost or all of the descriptions for what quantifiers start with “matches any string with” or “matches any string that.” And then in each of the examples they provide, it says more specifics, for example, matches any string with and end at the end of it or that is for the n $ example. Additionally, quantifiers can determine any string that is followed by a specific string. Essentially, quantifiers tell you what to look for to match OR Operator
