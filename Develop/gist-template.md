## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors contain symbols like a caret and a dollar sign at the end of the string or \A letter to create bounderies. The \letter suggests the end of the string. Anchors are a way of telling you where you are at in your code. \A refers to the start. The parameters of regex can vary from language to language. Some characters are the same across multiple languages and have the same meaning, but that is not true for all of them.
